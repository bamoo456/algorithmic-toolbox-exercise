2 Problem: Majority Element Problem Introduction

An element of a sequence of length n is called a majority element if it appears in the sequence strictly more than n/2 times.
Problem Description
Task. The goal in this code problem is to check whether an input sequence contains a majority element. Input Format. The first line contains an integer n, the next one contains a sequence of n non-negative
integers a0, a1, . . . , an−1.
Constraints. 1≤n≤105;0≤ai ≤109 forall0≤i<n.
Output Format. Output 1 if the sequence contains a majority element and 0 otherwise.
Time Limits. C: 1 sec, C++: 1 sec, Java: 1.5 sec, Python: 5 sec. 3 sec, Ruby: 3 sec, Scala: 3 sec.
Memory Limit. 64Mb.
