5 Advanced Problem: Huge Fibonacci Number modulo m

(Recall that advanced problems are not covered in the video lectures and
require additional ideas to be
solved. We therefore strongly recommend you start solving these problems
only when you are done with the
basic problems.)
Problem Introduction
The Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows: F0 = 0, F1 = 1, and Fi =
Fi−1 + Fi−2 for i ≥ 2.
Problem Description
Task. Given two integers n and m, output Fn mod m (that is, the
remainder of Fn when divided by m).
Input Format. The input consists of two integers n and m given on the
same line (separated by a space).
Constraints. 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^5
.
Output Format. Output Fn mod m.
Time Limits. C: 1 sec, C++: 1 sec, Java: 1.5 sec, Python: 5 sec.
Memory Limit. 64Mb.
