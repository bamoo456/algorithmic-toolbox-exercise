2 Problem: Fractional Knapsack Problem Introduction

Given a set of items and total capacity of a knapsack, find the maximal
value of fractions of items that fit into the knapsack.
Problem Description
Task. The goal of this code problem is to implement an algorithm for the
fractional knapsack problem.
Input Format. The first line of the input contains the number n of items
and the capacity W of a knapsack. The next n lines define the values and
weights of the items. The i-th line contain integers vi and wi — the
value and the weight of i-th item, respectively.
Constraints. 1≤n≤103,0≤W ≤2·106;0≤vi ≤2·106,0<wi ≤2·106 forall1≤i≤n.
Allthe numbers are integers.
Output Format. Output the maximal value of fractions of items that fit
into the knapsack. The absolute value of the difference between the
answer of your program and the optimal value should be at most 10−3. To
ensure this, output your answer with at least four digits after the
decimal point (otherwise your answer, while being computed correctly,
can turn out to be wrong because of rounding issues).
Time Limits. C: 1 sec, C++: 1 sec, Java: 1.5 sec, Python: 5 sec.
Memory Limit. 64Mb.
